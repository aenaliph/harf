        <p align="justify">I am a doctoral candidate in <i>Computational Linguistics</i> at IIIT-Hyderabad. My research currently focuses on <i>Literary Machine Translation</i> but I am broadly interested in applying NLP techniques to figurative language use. I also work around topics in machine translation <i>Postediting</i> and <i>Evaluation</i>.</p>
        <br>
        <p align="justify">Prior to my present academic pursuits, I worked in the software industry in engineering and managerial roles for almost a decade, mostly in the areas of Machine Translation, Analytics, Globalization Engineering and Localization.</p>

        <p align="justify">This blog (مہر نیم روز , mehr-e-neem-roz, which translates to noon-day-sun) is meant to document interesting cases of language use and technology implications that I come across. I also intend it as a learning aid – to document, classify and memorize topics, techniques and code.</p>
